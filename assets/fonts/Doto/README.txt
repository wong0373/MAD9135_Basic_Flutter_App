Doto Variable Font
==================

This download contains Doto as both a variable font and static fonts.

Doto is a variable font with these axes:
  ROND
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in a single file:
  Doto-VariableFont_ROND,wght.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that aren’t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
in those cases you can use the static font files for Doto:
  static/Doto-Thin.ttf
  static/Doto-ExtraLight.ttf
  static/Doto-Light.ttf
  static/Doto-Regular.ttf
  static/Doto-Medium.ttf
